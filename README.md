# Momo UI _Comic relief_ - Design System

![Isologo Momo UI](./public/logos/isologo/296x80.png?raw=true "Botones de Momo UI")

Our goal is to create a design system that is lightweight for the user and contrasts with the stress situations they may be experiencing. As a result we want you to have a fun and quiet experience ðŸ˜Œ
