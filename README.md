# Momo UI - Design System

![Momo UI logo](./public/logos/isologo/296x80-bg.png?raw=true "Momo UI logo")

The _Comic relief_ design system for React.js projects.

Our goal is to create a design system that is lightweight for the user and contrasts with the stress situations they may be experiencing. As a result we want them to have a fun and quiet experience ðŸ˜Œ

## Check it out

We use Storybook to document and review the development of our design system. There you will find what components do we have, how they look, and what code you should use to implement them.

[See our storybook](https://main--60903c91deb02d003b84f0cb.chromatic.com/)

## Use it in your app

Momo UI components are developed with [React.js](https://reactjs.org/) using [styled-components](https://styled-components.com/). To set general styles and use it in your own React project, follow these instructions:

Install the npm [momo-ui package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@superys/momo-ui) in your project

```
yarn add @superys/momo-ui

or

npm i @superys/momo-ui
```

Load fonts and icons ([phosphor icons](https://phosphoricons.com/)) in your `public/index.html` head tag

```html
<head>
  ...

  <!-- Load Google fonts -->
  <link rel="preconnect" href="https://fonts.googleapis.com" />
  <link rel="preconnect" href="https://fonts.gstatic.com" crossorigin />
  <link
    href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Fredoka+One&family=Nunito+Sans:wght@300;400;600;700&family=Quicksand:wght@400;700&display=swap"
    rel="stylesheet"
  />

  <!-- Load Phosphor icons -->
  <script src="https://unpkg.com/phosphor-icons"></script>
</head>
```

Set the global styles before your app is mounted (probably `src/index.jsx`)

```jsx
...
import { GlobalStyle } from "@superys/momo-ui";
...

ReactDOM.render(
  <React.StrictMode>
    <GlobalStyle />
    <App />
  </React.StrictMode>,
  document.getElementById("root")
);
```

Use the components in your app!

```jsx
import { Button } from "@superys/momo-ui";

function App() {
  return (
    <div>
      ...
      <Button>You got it!</Button>
    </div>
  );
}
```

You're ready to go. To know more about momo-ui components, please [check our storybook](https://main--60903c91deb02d003b84f0cb.chromatic.com/) where you will find everything you need.
