# Inputs

The Inputs of Momo UI are very practical. You won't find a `select` or `text-area` component. All of these variants are included in this component.

## Usage

Inputs are used to get information from the user. You can find theme inside a form, a search bar, or basically anywhere.

## Text Input

Text Inputs can be used used for names, short prases or similar.

<Preview withToolbar>
  <Story name="primary">
    <Input type="text" placeholder="Hello World" />
  </Story>
</Preview>
