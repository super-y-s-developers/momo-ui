# Buttons ðŸ‘†

Buttons are used to trigger actions within an application.

## Usage

Buttons are used to trigger internal actions within your web applications.

## Primary Buttons

Primary buttons are used as a call to action and indicate the most important action on a page.

<Preview withToolbar>
  <Story name="primary">
    <PrimaryButton onClick={action("button-click")}>Hello world</PrimaryButton>
  </Story>
</Preview>

## Secondary Buttons

Secondary buttons are usually next to a primary button as the second most important action on the page.

<Story name="secondary">
  <SecondaryButton>Hello world</SecondaryButton>
</Story>

## Tertiary Buttons

Tertiary buttons are used as low important actions.

<Story name="tertiary">
  <TertiaryButton>Hello world</TertiaryButton>
</Story>
